blurb=Jenkins will first does svn cleanup of root repository, then removes all the unversioned/modified files/directories (also in externals it does svn cleanup before the removing), as well as files/directories ignored by "svn:ignore", then execute "svn update". \
  This emulates the fresh check out behaviour without the cost of full checkout.
